# Python bruteforce example

These are sample terminal scripts for hashing passwords, and bruteforcing them.
Only for demo purposes as the scripts are not optimized and only take alphanumeric characters into account.


## Hashing password

```py
    python3 sha.py

```

## Bruteforce with iterations

```py
    python3 withrounds.py
```
